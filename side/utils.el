;; This file provide some utility functions for developing `typst-ts-mode'
;; It is not supposed to be loaded by package managers.

;; gain the functions here by evaluating buffer.

  (interactive)
  (setq debug-on-error t
        treesit--indent-verbose t)
  (treesit-explore-mode 1)
  (treesit-inspect-mode 1)

  ;; note that when in intensive testing, you'd better turn off `auto-save-visited-mode'
  (whitespace-mode 1))
